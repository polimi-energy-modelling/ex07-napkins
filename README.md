# The napkins plan optimization problem

A new company is hired to provide food for 8 consecutive dinners, happening in the next 8 days. The number of people expected on each day is 80, 120, 66, 75, 100, 120 135 and 150 respectively. Napkins can be bought at 1 EUR each, or can be sent to laundry, washed and used on subsequent days.  Two types of laundry are available.  A fast laundry charges 0.30 EUR per unit and will deliver for use on the second day. A slow laundry costs 0.20 EUR per unit and can deliver for use on the third day.

2. What is a least cost napkins plan that also minimizes the number of napkins used and not sent to laundry?
3. In which day would one additional person at the dinner table cause the highest increase in cost?
